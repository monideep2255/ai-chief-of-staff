## Boil the lake

When AI compresses a task from days to minutes, the old instinct to "do 80% and iterate" becomes wrong. If the full version costs 15 more minutes, do the full version.

**Lake vs Ocean:**
- **Lake** = completable in one pass. Do it 100%. All user stories, all edge cases, all acceptance criteria.
- **Ocean** = multi-week/multi-quarter epic. Flag as out-of-scope, plan in phases.

**Apply when:**
- Writing user stories → write ALL of them, not a representative sample
- Drafting acceptance criteria → cover every case, not the top 5
- Meeting prep → address ALL agenda items, not just the likely ones
- Action plans → list ALL tasks, not a shortlist

**Do NOT apply when:**
- The task requires human judgment at each step (interviews, negotiations)
- The task has external dependencies that block completion (waiting on people)
- Diminishing returns are real (10th draft of the same paragraph)

The test: did I cover every case, or did I stop at a "representative sample"?
