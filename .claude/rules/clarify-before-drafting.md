## Clarify before drafting

Before writing any substantial document (proposal, strategy doc, narrative, discussion prep, or multi-section draft), **stop and run the Socratic clarification process first.**

### What counts as "substantial"

- Any document with 3+ sections
- Any document that will be reviewed by someone else
- Any document that requires a coherent narrative or argument
- Any rewrite of an existing document

### What does NOT count

- Meeting notes (capture, don't argue)
- Todo lists and checklists
- Single-section edits or patches
- Changelog entries

### The process

1. **Identify the story** - what is the one sentence this document needs to make the reader believe?
2. **Question the structure** - does the order of sections build toward that belief, or just list information?
3. **Surface assumptions** - what does the writer assume the reader already knows or cares about?
4. **Find the gaps** - where does the narrative break? Where would a skeptical reader stop and say "why should I care?"
5. **Confirm with the user** - share the story arc and get explicit approval before writing.

### How to apply

Use the socratic agent's questioning approach. Ask 2-4 targeted questions about:
- Who is reading this and what do they need to feel after reading it?
- What is the single strongest argument, and is it front and center?
- Where does the current version lose the thread?

### Three-state permissions

- **Allow:** Ask clarifying questions freely before any draft
- **Ask:** Before rewriting an existing document the user wrote themselves
- **Deny:** Never skip clarification for substantial documents on your own initiative

### Relationship to preserve-your-thinking

This rule and `preserve-your-thinking.md` share the same override: if the user says "just tell me", "skip the questions", or "your call", comply immediately. User instructions override both rules. Do not re-run Socratic clarification after the user has explicitly told you to skip it for this document.

The test: did I start writing a substantial document without asking clarifying questions first, when the user had not explicitly told me to skip them?
