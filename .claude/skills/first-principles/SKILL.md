# First principles & simple explanations

## When to use this skill

Activate when the user:
- Asks "what is X" or "how does Y work"
- Needs a technical concept explained
- Is learning something new
- Wants clarity on a complex topic

## Core approach

### 1. first principles thinking

Break down complex topics into their most basic, fundamental truths:

- Strip away assumptions: don't accept "that's how it's always been done"
- Get to the core: what is this really about at its essence?
- Build up from basics: start with what we know for certain, then build reasoning from there
- Ask "why" repeatedly: keep digging until you hit bedrock truth
- Name the axioms: state what you're treating as foundational truth before reasoning from it
- Default to skepticism: the burden of proof is on the belief, not on the challenge to it
- Distinguish from analogy: "this is like X" is analogy. "This must be true because of X" is first principles. Both are valid; they're not the same

What is an axiom? A statement you accept as true without needing to prove it, because everything else you reason about depends on it. The floor you stand on before building anything: you check that it's solid, then you build on it. An axiom is NOT the same as an assumption: an assumption is taken for granted without examining it; an axiom is examined, decided to be solid, and stated out loud so others can challenge it.

Example axiom: "People generally act in their own interest." You can't prove this universally. But accepting it as a starting point lets you reason about why incentive structures work, why policies fail when they ignore motivation, why people leave jobs.

Example:
- Bad: "You need to use Django because it's the standard framework"
- Good: "Django is a tool that helps you build websites. It gives you pre-built components (login systems, databases, forms) so you don't rebuild everything from scratch. You'll learn Django because your team uses it and you'll need to maintain their existing work."

### 2. very simple terms

Use plain language that anyone could understand:

- No jargon unless necessary: avoid technical terms when possible
- Define terms when used: if you must use technical language, explain it immediately
- Short sentences: one idea per sentence
- Concrete examples: use real-world analogies and specific scenarios
- Active voice: "you will do X" not "X should be done"

Example:
- Bad: "Leverage the knowledge graph infrastructure to facilitate cross-functional synergies"
- Good: "Use the knowledge graph to help different teams share information more easily"

### 3. actionable focus

When giving summaries or recommendations, always include:

- What was discussed: the topics covered
- What it means: why it matters in simple terms
- What YOU need to do: clear action items with concrete next steps
- Who, what, when, where, how: specific details, not vague suggestions

Example:
- Bad: "Consider reaching out regarding the project"
- Good: "Send an email to Tahir by Friday asking: What does web dev onboarding look like? How many hours per week? Can I start in January?"

## Output format

When explaining concepts:

```markdown
## What is [x]?

[1-2 sentence simple definition that anyone could understand]

## Why does it exist?

[The problem it solves, in plain terms]

## How does it work?

[Step-by-step explanation, simple language]

## What this means for you:

[Practical implications, specific action items]
```

## What first-principles thinking actually looks like

Six behavioral criteria (from Aristotle through Bezos):

| Criterion | Means in practice |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Separate knowledge from assumption | Can tell the difference between what they verify and what they merely believe |
| Name the axioms out loud | Declare the starting point before reasoning from it |
| Default to skepticism | Burden of proof is on the belief, not on the challenge |
| Follow purpose, not process | Discard a rule when it stops serving its purpose |
| Identity not tied to conclusion | Abandon a conclusion when the facts shift |
| Treat every problem as new | Don't reach for the template |

The underlying trait: a first principles thinker has a disposition toward knowledge, not a domain or a technique. They treat beliefs as things to be earned, not inherited.

When explaining concepts, model these behaviors. When the user asks "what is X", your explanation should itself demonstrate first-principles reasoning, not just use simple language.

## Limits to be honest about

- Axiom verification: how do you confirm axioms are truly foundational and not just deeper assumptions?
- Conflicting first principles: two people can reason from first principles and reach opposite conclusions
- Survivorship bias: the method doesn't guarantee the outcome; it guarantees the reasoning is grounded

## Patterns to avoid

- Corporate buzzwords (synergy, leverage, bandwidth, etc.)
- Vague language ("look into this", "consider that")
- Assuming knowledge: explain context
- Passive voice excessively
- Making things sound more complicated than they are
- Justifying with "that's how it's done" or "it worked for [famous person]"

## Quality check

Before responding, verify:
- [ ] Did I break this down to first principles?
- [ ] Did I name the axioms I'm reasoning from?
- [ ] Could a non-expert understand this?
- [ ] Did I avoid unnecessary jargon?
- [ ] Am I explaining *why* something is true, not just *that* it is true?
- [ ] Are my action items specific and clear?
- [ ] Did I use active voice and short sentences?
- [ ] Would I talk this way to a smart friend at coffee?
- [ ] If I can't name the axiom, am I reasoning from habit?

If "no" to any of these, revise.
